Mess with Process
========
This simple module will overwrite memory of any C program process.
This was part of my kernel mode dev journey.
Although the module is quite simple, it tought me a lot of memory management, espcially kernel memory.

You have to pass the PID of the process you want to write to when insmod'ing the module, eg. insmod mwpk.ko pid=x
You can also have kernel logging by setting the debug bit during build `make debug=1`

Let's say you want to overwrite argv[0], e.g. ./main, you simply do echo "./main ./nomain" > /proc/mwpk.
